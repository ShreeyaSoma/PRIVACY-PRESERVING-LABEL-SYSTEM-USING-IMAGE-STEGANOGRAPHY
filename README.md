# PRIVACY-PRESERVING-LABEL-SYSTEM-USING-IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY
A system to securely embed delivery information within images using steganography to protect user privacy on parcel labels.


## 🔍 Problem Addressed

Millions of packages are delivered daily with sensitive personal details printed openly on their labels. These labels, once discarded or misused, can lead to data theft, stalking, fraud, and other privacy violations. While digital data is encrypted, **physical delivery information often remains exposed**.

This project solves that gap by making delivery information invisible — yet retrievable — through secure image-based data embedding.
